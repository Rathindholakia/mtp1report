PMU are vital in modern power grid due to advnacement in operation and control. Here in this report description of a PMU being developed using OMAP-L137, its testing and verification using a Full Spectrum Simulator (FSS) is discussed. The tests and its standardization reference is taken from smart-grid standard C37.118-2011. While developing the PMU, a custom high speed ADC board is designed, it is interfaced to OMAP using EMIFA - a new interfacing method available in OMAP-L13x processors, is used. This setup will be hooked up to mini-FSS which will provide different test signals. through this experiment we also want to see the usability of FSS in different scenario.
